# Hi there! I'm Andrea Guarneri 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm passionate about **front-end development** and am currently focused on honing my skills in **JavaScript** through hands-on projects and exercises. Here, you’ll find a showcase of my journey in coding, problem-solving, and experimenting with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

## 💻 What I’m Currently Working On

I’m building a solid foundation in JavaScript by working on real-world solutions and adopting a professional approach to code. Below is one of the key projects I’m actively working on:

## 🌼 Dynamic-seasonal-app 🌸❄️☀️🍂

This interactive web application allows users to input the current month (in numerical format) and dynamically displays the corresponding month name, season, and a themed background image. The app enhances user interaction and visual appeal using **JavaScript** and **Tailwind CSS**.

### 🌟 Key Features

- **User Prompt**: The app prompts users to enter the current month using a `prompt()`.
- **Dynamic Content Update**: It updates the displayed month name, season, and background image based on the user's input.
- **Error Handling**: If the user enters an invalid month number, an error message and an error-themed image are displayed with a red background.
- **Tailwind CSS Integration**: The project utilizes Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive design, adapting colors and layouts seamlessly.
- **Conditional Logic**: Implements `if-else` statements to determine the correct month name and corresponding season.
- **User-Friendly Experience**: Provides immediate feedback through visual changes and messages based on user input.

## 🛠️ Technologies and Skills

- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Writing modular, clean code while practicing key concepts.
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: Building structured, accessible, and responsive user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utilizing utility-first CSS for efficient and rapid UI development.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Dynamically altering page elements and styles based on user interactions.
- **Error Handling**: Implementing user-friendly error messages and fallback designs.

Feel free to clone, explore, and provide feedback on any of my projects! Each one represents a step in my journey to becoming a skilled front-end developer.
